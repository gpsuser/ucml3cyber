# Lecture 19 - Network Hardware

## Introduction

By the end of this session, you'll have a solid understanding of end-user computing devices, connectivity devices, and connection media. You'll also be equipped to evaluate which connection media best suits different scenarios and understand the security implications of the various network hardware components.

### End-User Devices

End-user devices are the gadgets we use to interact with the network.

- **Desktop Computers**
  - Usually powerful and versatile.
  - Ideal for intensive tasks like graphic design, software development, etc.
  
- **Laptops**
  - Portable and convenient for mobile use.
  
- **Tablets**
  - Touchscreen devices; great for browsing, light computing, and media consumption.

- **Smartphones**
  - Highly portable; combines communication and computing capabilities.

- **Wearables**
  - Smartwatches, fitness trackers; used for health monitoring and communication.

**Security Implications:**

- Ensure antivirus and anti-malware software is installed.
- Regular software updates to patch vulnerabilities.
- Use secure passwords and authentication methods.

### Connectivity Devices

#### Switches

- **Function:** Connect multiple devices on the same network.
- **Types:** Managed and unmanaged switches.
- **Security:** VLANs (Virtual LANs) for segmenting traffic; port security features.

#### Routers
- **Function:** Directs data packets between networks.
- **Features:** NAT (Network Address Translation), DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol).
- **Security:** Firewalls, VPN support, regular firmware updates.

#### Access Points

- **Function:** Allow wireless devices to connect to a wired network.
- **Types:** Standalone, controller-based.
- **Security:** WPA3 encryption, MAC address filtering.

#### USB Hubs
- **Function:** Expands a single USB port into several for additional peripherals.
- **Types:** Powered and unpowered.
- **Security:** Limit physical access, secure important ports.

#### Modems

- **Function:** Modulate and demodulate signals for internet connectivity.
- **Types:** DSL, cable, fiber.
- **Security:** Built-in firewalls, regular firmware updates.

**Security Implications:**

- Use encrypted connections (WPA3 for wireless, SSL/TLS for internet).
- Implement access control lists (ACLs).
- Regularly update firmware and software.

### Connection Media

#### Wired

- **Ethernet Cables**
  - Reliable and fast (up to 10 Gbps).
  - **Security:** Physical security to prevent tapping; use shielded cables.

- **Fiber Optic Cables**
  - Extremely high-speed and immune to electromagnetic interference.
  - **Security:** Difficult to tap but requires secure installation.

#### Wireless

- **Wi-Fi**
  - Commonly used for home and public networks.
  - **Security:** Use WPA3 encryption, disable SSID broadcasting if necessary.

- **Infrared**
  - Short-range, line-of-sight communication (e.g., TV remotes).
  - **Security:** Limited usage reduces security concerns.

- **Bluetooth**
  - For short-range communication between devices.
  - **Security:** Pairing encryption, regular software updates.

- **Li-Fi (Light Fidelity)**
  - Uses light waves for data transmission.
  - **Security:** Data transmission is confined to the line of sight.

**Security Implications:**

- Use strong encryption methods (e.g., WPA3 for Wi-Fi).
- Physical security for wired connections.
- Regular software and firmware updates for all devices.

### Other Network Hardware Components

- **Firewalls**
  - **Function:** Control incoming and outgoing network traffic.
  - **Types:** Hardware, software.
  - **Security:** Vital for network protection, use of intrusion detection/prevention systems.

- **Gateways**
  - **Function:** Connect networks using different protocols.
  - **Security:** Secure data translation and protocol conversion.

- **Network Interface Cards (NIC)**
  - **Function:** Connects a computer to a network.
  - **Security:** Use NICs with built-in security features.
