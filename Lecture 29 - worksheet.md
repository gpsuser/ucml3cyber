# Worksheets - Incident Response in Cyber Security

## Worksheet 1

1. What is the primary goal of an incident response policy?
2. List three key elements that should be included in an incident response policy document.
3. What is the purpose of the "Identifying the Type and Severity of the Compromise" stage in the incident response process?
4. Why is it important to protect evidence during the incident response process?
5. In the "System Recovery" stage, why is it preferable to restore systems from clean backups rather than simply removing the malware?
6. What are two potential consequences of not following the incident response stages in the correct order?
7. Describe the importance of regularly testing and refining an organization's incident response capabilities.


## Worksheet 2

1. An \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ is a set of guidelines that helps IT staff detect, respond to, and recover from network security incidents.

2. The \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ stage of incident response involves creating forensic copies of affected systems and storing original evidence securely.

3. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ should be engaged if criminal activity is suspected during an incident.

4. The incident response plan should include clear \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ for internal and external communication during an incident.

5. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ is a crucial step in the incident response process to prevent re-infection or further compromise.

6. Incident responders should use \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ to establish a detailed timeline of the incident and organize evidence.

7. The \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ stage of incident response focuses on determining how the breach occurred and what systems and data were affected.

8. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ within the incident response team should be clearly defined in the incident response policy.

9. The \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ of the incident should be determined to prioritize response efforts and allocate resources appropriately.

10. Regular \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ of the incident response plan through simulated exercises can help improve the team's preparedness.
