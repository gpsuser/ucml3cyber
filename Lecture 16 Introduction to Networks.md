# Lecture 16 - Computer Networks

This session intorduces the types of computer networks (five types).

There are two main learning objectives:

* Students are able to list the five types of networks and their features and evaluate the vulnerabilities for each type of network.
* Secondly, students are able to consider the use of networking architectures and principles for security - in particular - the students need to understand the security implications of different networked systems, including how to secure them in an organisational contexts


## Learning Aim 1: Types of Networks and Their Features

**1. Personal Area Network (PAN)**

- **Features:**
  - Smallest network type.
  - Covers a range of a few meters.
  - Typically used for connecting personal devices like smartphones, tablets, and laptops.
- **Vulnerabilities:**
  - Susceptible to unauthorized access if devices are not secured.
  - Data interception risks if communication is not encrypted.

**2. Local Area Network (LAN)**

- **Features:**
  - Covers a small geographical area like a home, office, or building.
  - High data transfer rates.
  - Typically uses Ethernet or Wi-Fi.
- **Vulnerabilities:**
  - Internal threats from within the organization.
  - Physical access to network devices can lead to security breaches.

**3. Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)**

- **Features:**
  - Spans a city or a large campus.
  - Connects multiple LANs.
- **Vulnerabilities:**
  - Higher risk of data interception due to larger coverage area.
  - More complex to secure due to multiple entry points.

**4. Wide Area Network (WAN)**

- **Features:**
  - Covers large geographical areas, often a country or continent.
  - Connects multiple LANs and MANs.
  - Uses technologies like MPLS, VPNs, and leased lines.
- **Vulnerabilities:**
  - Susceptible to cyber-attacks due to extensive reach.
  - Data integrity and confidentiality risks during transmission.

**5. Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN)**

- **Features:**
  - Similar to LAN but uses wireless technology.
  - Provides mobility and ease of installation.
  - Uses Wi-Fi standards.
- **Vulnerabilities:**
  - Prone to unauthorized access if not properly secured.
  - Interference and signal jamming risks.

## Learning Aim 2: Security Implications of Networked Systems

**1. Network Security Principles**

- **Confidentiality:** Ensuring that data is accessible only to those authorized to have access.
- **Integrity:** Maintaining the accuracy and completeness of data.
- **Availability:** Ensuring that authorized users have access to information and resources when needed.

**2. Security Measures for Different Network Types**

- **PAN:**
  - Use strong passwords and encryption for Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connections.
  - Regularly update device software to patch vulnerabilities.
- **LAN:**
  - Implement firewalls and intrusion detection systems.
  - Use VLANs to segment network traffic and limit access.
- **MAN:**
  - Encrypt data in transit using VPNs.
  - Regularly monitor network traffic for unusual activities.
- **WAN:**
  - Use secure communication protocols like SSL/TLS.
  - Implement multi-factor authentication for remote access.
- **WLAN:**
  - Use WPA3 encryption for Wi-Fi networks.
  - Disable SSID broadcasting and use MAC address filtering.

**3. Securing Networks in Organizational Contexts**

- **Network Access Control (NAC):** Ensuring that only authorized devices and users can access the network.
- **Regular Security Audits:** Conducting periodic reviews of network security policies and practices.
- **Employee Training:** Educating employees about security best practices and potential threats.
- **Incident Response Plan:** Having a plan in place to respond to security breaches and mitigate damage.
