# Lecture 25 - Cybersecurity Risk Assessment - Student Worksheets


## Worksheet 1

1. Define what "risk" means in the context of cybersecurity. Provide an example that would be relevant to your school environment.

2. Explain the relationship between probability and impact in determining risk severity. Use the formula taught in class.

3. Your school is considering implementing a new online learning platform. The platform requires students to use their school email addresses to log in. What three key factors would you consider when assessing the probability of a security breach?

4. Using the Risk Severity Matrix from the lecture, determine the overall risk severity for the following scenario:
   - A school's password policy allows simple 6-character passwords
   - Probability of breach: Very Likely
   - Impact of breach: Moderate
   Show your working and explain your answer.

5. Compare and contrast "Minor" and "Major" impacts in cybersecurity risk assessment. Provide one example of each.

6. A student finds a USB drive in the school parking lot. Explain how you would assess both the probability and impact components if someone plugs this USB drive into a school computer. Use the scales discussed in class.

7. Your school stores all student records in a cloud service. The service occasionally experiences short outages. Using the lecture's framework, classify this scenario's probability (Unlikely/Likely/Very Likely) and impact (Minor/Moderate/Major). Justify your answer.
