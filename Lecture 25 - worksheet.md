# Lecture 25 - Cybersecurity Risk Assessment - Student Worksheets

## Worksheet 1:

1. Define what "risk" means in the context of cybersecurity. Provide an example that would be relevant to your school environment.

2. Explain the relationship between probability and impact in determining risk severity. Use the formula taught in class.

3. Your school is considering implementing a new online learning platform. The platform requires students to use their school email addresses to log in. What three key factors would you consider when assessing the probability of a security breach?

4. Using the Risk Severity Matrix from the lecture, determine the overall risk severity for the following scenario:
   - A school's password policy allows simple 6-character passwords
   - Probability of breach: Very Likely
   - Impact of breach: Moderate
   Show your working and explain your answer.

5. Compare and contrast "Minor" and "Major" impacts in cybersecurity risk assessment. Provide one example of each.

6. A student finds a USB drive in the school parking lot. Explain how you would assess both the probability and impact components if someone plugs this USB drive into a school computer. Use the scales discussed in class.

7. Your school stores all student records in a cloud service. The service occasionally experiences short outages. Using the lecture's framework, classify this scenario's probability (Unlikely/Likely/Very Likely) and impact (Minor/Moderate/Major). Justify your answer.

### Worksheet 1: Solutions

1. **Risk Definition Solution:**
   A risk in cybersecurity is the potential for loss, damage, or compromise of assets or data through a cyber attack or breach. A relevant school example would be the risk of unauthorized access to the student grades database, which could lead to grade tampering or privacy violations.

2. **Relationship Solution:**
   Risk Severity = Probability × Impact
   This means that the overall severity of a risk is determined by multiplying the likelihood of a threat occurring by the potential impact of that threat. For example, a highly probable threat with major impact would result in extreme risk severity.

3. **Key Factors Solution:**
   Three key factors to consider:
   - How easily can the platform be accessed by unauthorized users? (Ease of execution)
   - What valuable data could attackers obtain? (Potential reward - student emails, personal information)
   - How likely is unauthorized access to be detected? (Detection risk)

4. **Risk Matrix Solution:**
   Using the Risk Severity Matrix:
   - Probability: Very Likely (row)
   - Impact: Moderate (column)
   - Looking at the intersection: High severity
   This means the weak password policy presents a high risk and requires significant protective measures.

5. **Impact Comparison Solution:**
   Minor Impact:
   - Minimal disruption to operations
   - Example: Temporary inability to access non-essential school website
   
   Major Impact:
   - Significant harm to operations or reputation
   - Example: Complete breach of student personal information requiring legal notification and potential legal consequences

6. **USB Scenario Solution:**
   Probability Assessment:
   - Very Likely - USB drops are a common attack vector
   - Easy to execute (just plug in)
   - Could be deliberately placed (targeted attack)
   
   Impact Assessment:
   - Major - Could contain malware that:
     - Spreads through school network
     - Steals sensitive data
     - Encrypts important files
   
   Overall Severity: Extreme (Very Likely × Major)

7. **Cloud Service Solution:**
   Probability: Likely
   - Service outages are expected but not constant
   - Industry standard for cloud services to have occasional downtime
   
   Impact: Minor
   - Short outages
   - Temporary loss of access only
   - No permanent data loss
   
   Justification: Cloud services typically have redundancy and backup systems, making data loss unlikely. Short outages cause inconvenience but don't significantly impact long-term operations.
