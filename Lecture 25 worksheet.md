# Cybersecurity Risk Assessment - Practice Worksheets

## Worksheet  1


---

**Instructions:** Answer the following questions based on the lecture content on Cybersecurity Risk Assessment. Show your work where calculations are required.

1. Define cybersecurity risk and list its four key components.

2. Using the Risk Measurement Formula discussed in class, calculate the risk level for a scenario where:
   - Probability of occurrence = 4 (High)
   - Potential Impact = 3 (Moderate)
   What risk category does this fall into on the Risk Severity Matrix?

3. A school's computer lab has weak password policies, and there have been multiple attempts to access unauthorized accounts in the past month. Using the Probability Scale from the lecture:
   a) What probability level would you assign to this threat?
   b) Justify your answer.

4. On the Impact Scale, what level of severity would you assign to a data breach that causes:
   - $75,000 in damages
   - Partial system shutdown
   - Moderate reputation damage
   Explain your reasoning.

5. Study this scenario:
   "A school's website is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. The system contains student records and basic financial information."
   Using the Risk Severity Matrix, provide:
   a) Probability rating (1-5)
   b) Impact rating (1-5)
   c) Overall risk level (L, M, H, or E)
   d) Recommended response timeline based on the Prevention Framework

6. List three specific actions that should be taken for a risk rated as "High" according to the Prevention Framework.

7. Explain the difference between how you would handle a "Medium" risk versus an "Extreme" risk, according to the Response Actions Required table.

5. In the Prevention Framework, ________ risk requires action within 24 hours, while ________ risk can be handled during regular security assessments.

6. A risk with probability level ________ and impact level ________ would result in an Extreme risk rating on the severity matrix.

7. The key components of risk assessment include threats, ________, impact, and ________.

8. According to the Impact Scale, a ________ disruption with financial impact between $10,000-$49,999 is considered a ________ severity level.

9. For Medium risks, the Prevention Framework requires developing an action plan within ________ and implementing ________ procedures.

10. In the Risk Prevention Matrix, ________ risks require immediate ________ of the affected systems if necessary.
