# IT Policies - Documenting Risk in Cybersecurity 

## Introduction

In today's digital landscape, cybersecurity has become a critical concern for organizations of all sizes. As cyber threats continue to evolve and increase in sophistication, it is essential to have robust IT policies in place to govern the behavior of users and establish procedures for dealing with potential threats. 

In this lecture, we will explore the importance of IT policies in the context of cybersecurity and discuss key policies that organizations should implement to protect their systems and data.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, students will be able to:

1. Understand the role of IT policies in cybersecurity
2. List essential IT policies relating to security
3. Create an example of an IT policy
4. Explain the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) loop in the context of cybersecurity

## Cybersecurity Policy

Cybersecurity policies are a set of rules and guidelines that define how an organization protects its systems, networks, and data from cyber threats. These policies outline who is responsible for enforcing cybersecurity measures and provide security rules for employees who have access to sensitive data and systems.

It is important to note that identifying needs and creating cybersecurity policies is an ongoing process, as cyber threats are constantly evolving. Organizations must continuously assess their security posture and update their policies to address new threats and vulnerabilities.

The ISO 27001 standard provides a framework for organizations to develop their Information Security Management System (ISMS), which encompasses cybersecurity policies and procedures. The standard uses a "Plan-Do-Check-Act" (PDCA) loop to ensure a continuous improvement process.

## Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) Loop

The `PDCA` loop is a four-step process that organizations can use to manage and improve their cybersecurity policies and procedures continuously. 

This approach ensures that the latest threats are mitigated, and systems and data remain secure. The four steps are as follows:

1. `Plan`: Identify risks, establish objectives, and develop policies and procedures to address those risks.
2. `Do`: Implement the policies and procedures developed in the planning phase.
3. `Check`: Monitor and measure the effectiveness of the implemented policies and procedures.
4. `Act`: Take corrective actions based on the results of the check phase and make improvements to the policies and procedures.

By following the PDCA loop, organizations can ensure that their cybersecurity policies and procedures remain up-to-date and effective in the face of evolving cyber threats.

## Organization Policies

To maintain a secure environment, organizations must implement a variety of security policies and procedures that govern the actions of users and how they interact with systems and data. Some key policies include:

1. `Internet Usage Policy`: Defines acceptable use of the internet and outlines prohibited activities.

    * A set of rules a user must stick to when using company internet, may include:

        * Do use the internet in an acceptable way
        * Do not send discriminatory or threatening messages/images
        * Do not visit sites containing obscene, hateful or illegal material
        * Do not use the internet to complete any type of fraud or piracy


2. `Email Usage Policy`: Establishes guidelines for the appropriate use of email and highlights potential security risks.

    * A set of rules a user must stick to when using company emails accounts, may include:

        * Emails sent via company emails must not contain offensive content (including abusive language) 
        * Do not forward confidential emails to external locations
        * Do not use company email addresses for personal use
        * Do not open attachments from unknown sources

3. `Internet and Email Policies` : Outlines the rules and guidelines for using the internet and email within the organization.

    * A breach of these policies will be considered a disciplinary issue and could lead to dismissal

    * This ensures the policies are followed and mitigates any risk to a business

4. `Security Policy`: Outlines the organization's overall approach to security and defines roles and responsibilities.

    * Rules that must be followed to ensure equipment and data are safe, includes:

        * Setting access levels (principle of least privilege)
        * Compliance with GDPR
        * Information ownership responsibilities

5. `Password Policy`: Provides guidelines for creating strong passwords and managing them securely.

    * Rules that must be followed when setting and using passwords, may include: 

        * Complexity rules (minimum characters)
        * Sharing and storing passwords 
        * Password timeframe (3-6 months)

6. `Staff Responsibility Policy`: Defines the responsibilities of employees in maintaining the security of the organization's systems and data.

    * Rules that must be followed by staff to keep IT systems secure, may include:

        * Locking rooms when empty and setting alarms
        * Storing devices in locked cabinets
        * Locking PCs when away from desk
        * Updating software to latest versions

7. `*Staff IT Security Training Policy*`: Ensures that employees receive regular training on cybersecurity best practices and are aware of potential threats.

    * Making staff aware of policies/procedures/ responsibilities:

        * What training is required for staff regarding IT security?
        * How often it needs to be completed (usually annually)?
        * Will be tailored to job roles and define specific responsibilities?

8. `Backup Policy`: Establishes procedures for regularly backing up critical data and systems to ensure business continuity in the event of a security incident.

    It should cover:
    * Selection of data – what data is included in the backup?
    * Backup method – full, incremental or differential?
    * Backup frequency – How often? What day/time?
    * Storage location – On-site, off-site or cloud?

    This policy may also include:

    * Policy for restoring data

        * Expected length of time for restoration?
        * How to request a data restoration?

9. `Data Protection Policy`: Outlines how the organization protects sensitive data and ensures compliance with relevant regulations, such as GDPR or HIPAA.

* A business must have a data protection policy under this law
* It must set clear guidelines on how and why a business handles personal data.

    It may include the following: 

    * Why is the policy required? (what data is being collected)
    * Scope of the policy
    * Roles and responsibilities of employees for handling personal data
    * How violations of the policy will be handled

(`recall`: We have previously covered data protection, keeping individuals data safe.)

## Security Audits

Security audits are an essential component of an organization's cybersecurity strategy. 

These audits involve a systematic evaluation of an organization's security controls, policies, and procedures to identify weaknesses and areas for improvement. 

Regular security audits help organizations:

1. Assess the effectiveness of their current security measures
2. Identify potential vulnerabilities and risks
3. Ensure compliance with industry standards and regulations
4. Provide recommendations for improving security posture

By conducting regular security audits, organizations can proactively identify and address security gaps, reducing the risk of a successful cyber attack.

Stated slightly differently: organisations should `technically assess` how effectively security policies and procedures have been implemented throughout the business.

    Their role will be to:

    * Interview and observe staff
    * Inspect IT systems, equipment and rooms
    * Analyse files stored on the systems
    * Complete a technical examination (hardware and software, configuration)

* A security report, including corrective actions will be created and shared with the business.

* This should be a regular process, ensuring continuous improvement to protect against latest threats


## Conclusion

In conclusion, IT policies play a critical role in maintaining a robust cybersecurity posture. By implementing comprehensive policies and procedures, organizations can govern user behavior, protect sensitive data, and establish a framework for dealing with potential cyber threats. 

The `Plan-Do-Check-Act` loop provides a continuous improvement process that ensures policies remain effective in the face of evolving threats.

As future cybersecurity professionals, it is essential to understand the importance of IT policies and be able to create and implement them effectively. 

By doing so, you will be well-equipped to help organizations protect their systems and data from the ever-growing threat of cyber attacks.
