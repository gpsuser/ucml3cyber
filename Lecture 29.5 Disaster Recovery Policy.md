# Lecture 29.5 - Disaster Recovery Policy in Cybersecurity

## Introduction 

In today's digital world, organizations heavily rely on technology and data to operate. Disruptions to critical IT systems, whether from cyberattacks, natural disasters, or human error, can have severe consequences. Having a well-defined Disaster Recovery (DR) Policy is essential to minimize downtime, data loss, and ensure business continuity. In this lecture, we will explore the key components of a DR policy, identify critical systems, and discuss strategies for prevention, response, and recovery.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, you should be able to:

1. Define what a Disaster Recovery Policy is and explain its importance 
2. Identify critical systems and assign appropriate recovery objectives
3. Understand key strategies for preventing, responding to, and recovering from disasters
4. Describe the typical structure and elements of a DR plan document

## Disaster Recovery Policy 

### Definition

A Disaster Recovery Policy is a documented set of procedures to enable the recovery or continuation of critical technology infrastructure and systems following a disaster. The goal is to minimize business impact and get operations back to normal as quickly as possible.

### The Impact of Events and Need for Disaster Recovery

Disruptive events can significantly impact an organization's ability to function. Some examples:

| Event                 | Potential Impact                                            |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Cyberattack/Data Breach | Data loss, system downtime, reputational damage, legal issues |
| Natural Disaster        | Physical damage to infrastructure, extended downtime          |
| Hardware/Software Failure | Data corruption, system unavailability                        |
| Human Error              | Accidental data deletion, misconfiguration, security gaps   |

The financial and reputational costs of extended downtime make having a solid DR policy critical. Proactively planning for potential disasters is far less painful than scrambling to recover afterward.

## Identification of Critical Systems

### Definition

Critical systems are the IT assets essential for an organization to perform its core functions. Losing these systems would prevent the business from operating normally.

### Examples

- Customer-facing applications and databases
- Financial and billing systems  
- Email and communication platforms
- Domain controllers and authentication services

### System Prioritization

Not all systems are equally critical. The DR policy should rank systems based on their importance to the business. High priority systems get recovered first.

### RPO and RTO

Two key metrics help quantify system criticality:
- Recovery Point Objective (RPO): The maximum tolerable period of data loss. How much data can you afford to lose? 
- Recovery Time Objective (RTO): The maximum tolerable downtime before severe impact to the business. How long can the system be down?

Assigning RPO and RTO to each critical system ensures recovery efforts align with business priorities. Tighter RPOs require more frequent backups. Shorter RTOs demand more resilient system architectures. DR policies must balance recovery objectives against their cost to implement.

## Prevention, Response & Recovery Strategies

### DR Policy Definitions

The DR policy lays out strategies for each phase of a disaster scenario:
- Prevention: Measures to reduce the risk of a disaster occurring
- Response: The steps to take immediately after an incident to contain the impact
- Recovery: The process of restoring critical systems to normal operation

### Roles & Responsibilities 

A successful response requires a clear chain of command. The DR policy should define:
- The criteria to declare a disaster and trigger the DR plan
- Who has authority to invoke the plan 
- Specific roles and responsibilities of the DR team members

### Infrastructure Requirements

The policy must identify the alternate equipment, facilities, and infrastructure needed for recovery:
- Backup data center location(s)
- Replacement servers, storage, network equipment 
- Redundant communication links  
- Backup power systems

### Data Backups

Having clean, tested backups is essential to recovery. The DR policy should specify:
- Backup frequency (aligned with RPO)
- Backup storage location(s)  
- Offsite/offline copies for disaster resilience
- Backup testing and verification procedures

### Supplies & Vendors

Recovery may require external resources. Identify and pre-arrange:
- Sources of rental/replacement equipment
- Alternate workspace for employees if facilities are damaged
- Contracts with key vendors to prioritize service restoration

### Recovery Runbooks

Step-by-step recovery procedures should be documented for each critical system, customized to meet its specific RTO. Procedures should be detailed enough for secondary team members to execute and must be regularly updated as systems change.

## Disaster Recovery Plan Structure

### ISO Standards

Two key ISO standards provide guidance on structuring DR plans:

- ISO/IEC 27031: Guidelines for ICT readiness for business continuity
- ISO/IEC 24762: Guidelines for ICT disaster recovery services  

While not mandatory, aligning with ISO standards ensures the DR plan is comprehensive.

### Typical DR Plan Sections

1. Introduction
    - Policy objectives
    - Scope of the plan
    - Assumptions and constraints
2. Roles & Responsibilities  
    - DR team member contact info
    - Duties and decision-making authority
    - Interaction with other business continuity teams
3. Incident Response  
    - Criteria to declare a disaster and activate plan
    - Immediate steps to assess damage and contain impact
    - Procedures to notify stakeholders  
4. Recovery Procedures
    - Sequential recovery steps for each critical system
    - Detailed instructions for repair/rebuild/restore    
    - Integrating with business continuity plans
5. Appendices 
    - System priority list with RPO/RTO
    - Technical documentation and config info
    - Vendor and supplier contacts  
    - Copies of SLAs and contracts

## Conclusion

Having a robust Disaster Recovery Policy is no longer optional for organizations that rely on IT. Disruptions will happen, but their impact can be greatly reduced through proactive planning. By identifying critical systems, developing comprehensive recovery strategies, and thoroughly documenting procedures, an organization can face even worst-case scenarios with confidence. No one wants to put a DR plan to the test, but isn't it comforting to know it's there if you need it?
