# Lecture 26 - Risk Assessments in Cybersecurity

## Practice Worksheets

### Worksheet 1

#### Questions

1. What is risk assessment in the context of cybersecurity? Explain why organizations need to perform risk assessments continuously rather than as a one-time activity.

2. You are a cybersecurity consultant for a small medical clinic. List three specific scenarios when you would recommend conducting a risk assessment for this clinic.

3. In the 5-step risk assessment process, what is the difference between Step 1 (Identify Possible Threats) and Step 3 (Assess Vulnerabilities)? Provide an example to illustrate your answer.

4. A company has identified a potential threat where an employee might accidentally email sensitive customer data to the wrong recipient. Using the risk matrix from the lecture:
   - Classify the likelihood (Unlikely, Likely, Very Likely)
   - Classify the impact (Minor, Moderate, Major)
   - Determine the overall risk severity
   Justify each of your classifications.

5. Name three vulnerability assessment tools discussed in the lecture and explain what each one is specifically used to check or analyze.

6. Look at the following partial risk assessment template entry and identify two pieces of information that are inconsistent or incorrectly categorized:

| Label | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| Threat number | T-101 |
| Threat title | Server Room Temperature Control Failure |
| Probability | Medium |
| Impact | Critical |
| Risk severity | Medium |
| Explanation | Air conditioning system failure could lead to server overheating |

7. Your school is implementing a new online examination system. Using the blank risk assessment template from the lecture, create a complete entry for one potential cybersecurity threat this system might face.
