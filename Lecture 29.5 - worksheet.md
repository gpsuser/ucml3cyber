# Worksheets - Disaster Recovery Policy

## Worksheet 1

1. What is the primary goal of a Disaster Recovery Policy?
2. List three potential disruptive events that could impact an organization's IT systems.
3. What does RPO stand for, and what does it measure?
4. True or False: All IT systems in an organization are equally critical and should be recovered simultaneously. 
5. What are the three main phases of a disaster scenario that a DR policy should cover?
6. According to ISO standards, what are two typical sections you would expect to find in a DR plan document?
7. Why is regularly testing and updating a DR plan important?


# Worksheet 2

1. A \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ is a documented set of procedures to enable the recovery or continuation of vital technology infrastructure after a disaster.
2. The \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ is the maximum tolerable period of data loss measured in time. 
3. The \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ is the maximum tolerable amount of time that a system can be down after a failure or disaster occurs.
4. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ are the IT assets vital for an organization to perform its core functions.
5. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ is a metric in DR planning that represents the point in time to which data must be recovered after a disruption.
6. In a post-incident \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ phase, the steps are taken immediately after an incident to contain the impact.
7. The DR plan should identify \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ equipment, facilities, and infrastructure needed for recovery.
8. The DR policy should specify the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ location(s) for data and system backups.
9. Step-by-step \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ procedures should be documented for each critical system, customized to meet its specific RTO.
10. Aligning with \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ standards like ISO/IEC 27031 ensures the DR plan is comprehensive.

# Disaster Recovery Policy - Solution Worksheet 2 (Cloze Format - Answers Unscrambled)

1. A **Disaster Recovery Policy** is a documented set of procedures to enable the recovery or continuation of vital technology infrastructure after a disaster.
2. The **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)** is the maximum tolerable period of data loss measured in time.
3. The **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)** is the maximum tolerable amount of time that a system can be down after a failure or disaster occurs.  
4. **Critical systems** are the IT assets vital for an organization to perform its core functions.
5. **RPO** is a metric in DR planning that represents the point in time to which data must be recovered after a disruption.
6. In a post-incident **response** phase, the steps are taken immediately after an incident to contain the impact.
7. The DR plan should identify **alternate** equipment, facilities, and infrastructure needed for recovery.
8. The DR policy should specify the **storage** location(s) for data and system backups.
9. Step-by-step **recovery** procedures should be documented for each critical system, customized to meet its specific RTO.
10. Aligning with **ISO** standards like ISO/IEC 27031 ensures the DR plan is comprehensive.
